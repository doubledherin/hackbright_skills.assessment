hackbright_skills.assessment
============================
At the end of each week, Hackbright gives us code to write to assess whether we've reached the expected level of comprehension.

They are check-in points, meant to be used to self-assess. We are asked to time ourselves and to try to get faster and faster at implementing these pieces of code.
